# Adewumi Sunkanmi  
**Software Engineer**  
_Passionate about Database Systems, Big Data, and Education_

<p>Data is crucial to many organizations, from driving decisions to training AI models. Despite this immense potential, it can come from diverse sources in different formats, structures, and sizes, making data management non-trivial. The wide range of use cases for data provides ample room for innovation inspiring my interest in Database Systems, Big Data Analytics and Data Engineering.</p>

## Research Experience

### Independent Researcher (Dec 2023 - Present)
**Title:** Design and Implementation of a Road Safety Database in Nigeria  
**Advisor:** Professor O.C Akinyokun  
**Synopsis:**  [Recognized](https://x.com/andy_pavlo/status/1820436583977275426) as the first database from Nigeria by Professor Andy Pavlo from Carnegie Mellon University. A key-value store that reduces IO amplification during compaction by separating keys from values inspired by the WiscKey Paper from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It uses asynchronous IO based on the recent adoption of io_uring on Linux, showing up to [60%](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-uring/blob/master/DESIGN.md#:~:text=show%20up%20to-,60%25%20improvement.,-Though%20not%20yet) improvement compared to epoll. Written in Rust for memory safety. WiscKey benchmarks shows 1.4 to 14 times faster random lookups and 2.5 to 111 times speedier database loading than RocksDB.

- Built experimental version with core features such as Size-Tiered Compaction, Garbage Collector, Crash Recovery, Bloom Filter, and Value Log, and MemTable
- Improved concurrency by leveraging lock-free SkipMap from the Crossbeam library to store entries in MemTable
- Uses asynchronous IO based on io_uring, showing up to 60% improvement compared to epoll.

### Undergraduate Thesis (Jun 2023 - Dec 2023)
**Title:** Design and Implementation of a Road Safety Database in Nigeria  
**Advisor:** Professor O.C Akinyokun  
**Synopsis:** A relational database that integrates verified datasets from major institutions involved in road safety in Nigeria, such as the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), to help research groups generate and publish accurate statistics.

- Leveraged ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) mechanism to consolidate road safety data from various agencies, enabling comprehensive and more accurate data analytics for research groups and policymakers.
- Modelled all entities (32) using Entity Relationship Diagram to showcase all entities and the relationships between them  
- Implemented indexing by location to optimize the performance of queries related to geographical data   
- Wrote SQL queries to generate 10 statistics on road accidents presented during the final year project defence
